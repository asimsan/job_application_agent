This folder is intentionally kept out of version control for personal documents.

To run the job application agent:

1. Place your real resume as a PDF in this folder.
2. Name the file `base_resume.pdf`.

Example:

- `data/base_resume.pdf`  ← your actual CV (never committed to Git)

You can customize the code to point to a different file if you prefer, but keep real CVs and other personal documents untracked.
